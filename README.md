# 230-V-LED-staircase-lighting-controller
Controller for a large staircase consisting of 3 parts, total 26 stairs on 230 V LED strips. The controller has a built-in twilight sensor, the sensitivity of which can be adjusted using a potentiometer.
The construction of the controller was due to an unusual staircase and the desire not to use a separate power supply for 12-24V LEDs
